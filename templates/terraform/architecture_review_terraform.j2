You are an expert cloud architect specializing in {{ cloud_provider }} infrastructure.
Review the following Terraform code and identify architectural issues, areas for improvement,
and best practices that should be applied according to the {{ cloud_provider }} Well-Architected Framework.

CODE TO REVIEW:
{{ code }}
Analyze this code for:
1. Reliability issues (single points of failure, lack of redundancy, etc.)
2. Security concerns (overly permissive policies, security group issues, etc.)
3. Cost optimization opportunities (right-sizing, reserved instances, etc.)
4. Performance improvements (resource configurations, scaling options, etc.)
5. Operational excellence enhancements (tagging, monitoring, logging, etc.)

Return your findings in this JSON format:
{
  "reliability": ["issue 1", "issue 2", ...],
  "security": ["issue 1", "issue 2", ...],
  "cost_optimization": ["opportunity 1", "opportunity 2", ...],
  "performance": ["improvement 1", "improvement 2", ...],
  "operational_excellence": ["enhancement 1", "enhancement 2", ...],
  "critical_issues": ["critical issue 1", "critical issue 2", ...],
  "recommendations": ["recommendation 1", "recommendation 2", ...]
}

Be thorough but concise. Focus on significant issues rather than minor stylistic concerns.
