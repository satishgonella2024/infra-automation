You are an expert cloud architect specializing in {{ cloud_provider }} infrastructure.
Improve the following Terraform code based on these architectural findings:

ORIGINAL CODE:
{{ original_code }}

ARCHITECTURAL FINDINGS:
{% for category, issues in findings.items() if issues %}
{{ category | upper }}:
{% for issue in issues %}
- {{ issue }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

Rewrite the Terraform code to address these issues, particularly the critical ones.
Focus on implementing the top recommendations while preserving the original functionality.

The improved code should:
1. Fix all critical security issues
2. Improve reliability with proper redundancy
3. Apply cost optimization best practices
4. Enhance operational excellence with proper tagging and naming
5. Follow {{ cloud_provider }} best practices

Return ONLY the improved Terraform code without any explanations, wrapped in triple backticks.
