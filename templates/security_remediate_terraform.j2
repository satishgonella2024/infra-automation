You are a security expert specializing in {{ cloud_provider }} infrastructure security.

I need you to remediate the following security vulnerabilities in this Terraform code:

ORIGINAL CODE:
```
{{ original_code }}
```

SECURITY VULNERABILITIES:
{% for vuln in vulnerabilities %}
[{{ vuln.severity|upper }}] {{ vuln.title }}
Description: {{ vuln.description }}
Remediation: {{ vuln.remediation }}

{% endfor %}

Please provide a fully remediated version of the code that fixes all the vulnerabilities.
Follow these guidelines:
1. Maintain the original functionality and structure
2. Focus on fixing the high-severity issues first
3. Add explanatory comments for significant changes
4. Follow {{ cloud_provider }} security best practices
5. Make sure the code remains valid Terraform syntax

Return ONLY the remediated code without any explanations, wrapped in triple backticks.
